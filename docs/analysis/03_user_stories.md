# User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

This document breaks down the high-level Epics into specific, testable User Stories.

### Story Point Estimation
Story points are estimated using a modified Fibonacci sequence to represent the relative effort, complexity, and uncertainty of a task. We will use the following scale:

*   **1:** A very small, well-understood task with minimal effort.
*   **2:** A small task with low complexity.
*   **3:** A medium-sized task with understood complexity.
*   **5:** A large task with significant complexity or some uncertainty.
*   **8:** A very large or complex task that should ideally be broken down into smaller stories.
