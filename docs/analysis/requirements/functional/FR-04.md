# FR-04: Map JSONPath to Properties

The system shall map ingested MQTT payload values to specific properties of a Digital Asset using defined JSONPath expressions.

**Processing:** Extract values from payload using JSONPath; validate data types against asset property definitions.
**Outputs:** Mapped telemetry data point (asset ID, property name, value, timestamp).
