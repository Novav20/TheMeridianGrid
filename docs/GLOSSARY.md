# Glossary of Terms (The Meridian Grid)

This document provides definitions for key acronyms, standards, and concepts used in the TMG project documentation.

---

### A

*   **AAS (Asset Administration Shell):** A core concept of Industry 4.0, the AAS is the standardized "digital nameplate" for a physical asset. It provides a uniform way to describe an asset, its properties (both static and dynamic), and its capabilities.
*   **ACL (Access Control List):** A list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access and what operations are allowed.
*   **ADSO (Análisis y Desarrollo de Software):** The name of the SENA program in Colombia for Software Analysis and Development.

### B

*   **BPA (Business Process Analysis):** A methodology for analyzing an organization's business processes to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement.

### C

*   **CPS (Cyber-Physical System):** A system in which physical machinery and computational algorithms are tightly integrated, creating a feedback loop between the physical and digital worlds.

### D

*   **DevSecOps (Development, Security, and Operations):** An extension of DevOps that integrates security practices into every phase of the software development lifecycle.
*   **DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol 3):** A set of communication protocols used between components in process automation systems, common in utility companies.
*   **DTDL (Digital Twin Definition Language):** A language published by Microsoft for describing the models of digital twins (their properties, telemetry, commands, and relationships).

### E

*   **Epic:** In Agile methodologies, an Epic is a large body of work or a high-level feature that can be broken down into smaller, manageable "User Stories."
*   **EMMO (Elementary Multiperspective Material Ontology):** A foundational ontology that provides a framework for standardizing and integrating various domain-specific ontologies.

### F

*   **FR (Functional Requirement):** A requirement that defines a specific behavior or function of the system (e.g., "The user must be able to log in").

### G

*   **Gherkin:** A simple, structured language used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to write acceptance criteria for User Stories in a `Given-When-Then` format.

### H

*   **HMI (Human-Machine Interface):** The user interface or dashboard through which a human operator interacts with a machine or system.

### I

*   **IACS (Industrial Automation and Control Systems):** A general term for the collection of personnel, hardware, and software that can affect the safe and reliable operation of an industrial process.
*   **IEC 62443:** An international series of standards that define procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS).
*   **IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things):** The application of IoT to industrial settings, connecting machinery, sensors, and control systems to the internet.
*   **ISA-95:** An international standard for developing an automated interface between enterprise (business) systems and control systems.

### J

*   **JSONB:** A binary format for storing JSON data in a PostgreSQL database, offering improved performance for storage and querying.

### M

*   **MAPE-K Loop (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a Knowledgebase):** An architectural pattern for self-adaptive systems, describing a feedback loop for autonomous control.
*   **MTU (Master Terminal Unit):** The central controlling unit in a SCADA system that gathers data from remote devices.

### N

*   **NFR (Non-Functional Requirement):** A requirement that specifies criteria for judging the operation of a system, such as performance, security, or reliability.
*   **NFT (Non-Fungible Token):** A unique cryptographic token on a blockchain that can be used to represent ownership of a unique digital or physical asset.
*   **NIST SP 800-82:** A U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology publication that provides guidance on securing Industrial Control Systems.

### O

*   **OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture):** A cross-platform, open-source standard for data exchange between industrial systems, providing a common language for devices from different manufacturers.
*   **OT (Operational Technology):** The hardware and software that detects or causes a change through the direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices.
*   **OWL (Web Ontology Language):** A formal language for encoding knowledge and semantic relationships in a machine-readable format.

### P

*   **PRA (Probabilistic Risk Assessment):** A systematic methodology to evaluate risks associated with complex engineered systems.

### R

*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** A method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise.
*   **RBE (Report-by-Exception):** A data transmission strategy where data is only sent from a device when its value changes significantly, reducing bandwidth usage.
*   **RTU (Remote Terminal Unit):** A device that interfaces physical objects in the real world to a SCADA system.

### S

*   **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition):** A system of software and hardware elements that allows industrial organizations to control processes remotely.

### T

*   **TimescaleDB:** An open-source database extension for PostgreSQL that is optimized for time-series data.

### U

*   **User Story:** An informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user.
*   **UXD (User-Experience Design):** The process of designing products or services to provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.
